DODGE BALL: Objects and Classes Checkpoint 2

Code Plan: c0d3 g3wD

//Create a class for a dodge ball player where properties are assigned to players. Keys should include if they can throw the ball, dodge the ball, has paid their dues, is healthy, and how many years of experience they have. I will put these into my constructor as "canThrowBall", "canDodgeBall", "hasPaid", "isHealthy", "yearsExperience".

//Create new dodge ball player objects into a new array and display them in the DOM as available players.

//Make a button next to each player that lets the user assign them to red or blue teams. I will need to add these keys to as properties to the player class. In my constructor, I'll use "teamColor" and "mascot".

//To assign players to teams, I will use ``` this ``` keyword to assign the players using an onclick function.

//After the teams are selected, a new list will be created in the DOM with appropriate labels.

//I'll use three tests for the application
